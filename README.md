# Word Untangl-ing   

This is my solution for solving a coding challenge to count and list the amount of occurances a word is used in a given paragraph. This is written primarily with Javascript, but with some HTML and CSS for usability. No libraries nor depencies were used.    

Total time spent was roughly 7 hours. I spent around 4.5 hours solving the challenge with a Javascript function. Then 2.5 hours of testing, bug fixing,	 and setup.   

My code is done with a simple Javascript/CSS/HTML format. To ensure this runs correclty, please be sure all files are in the same folder, then open the html in your browser by dragging and dropping the html file into an open browser window.    

The expected result of this code is an alphabetical list where each line looks as follows:   
- numbering.   word  {occurences: sentence number of occurence, sentence number of next occurence, etc}   

The list will be alphabetical by the first letter of each word.   

To use the app, simply add your paragraph(s) to the text box. Then, click the button labeled "organize" to see the list of words underneath the text box.   
Sentences must start and end gramatically correct with sentence-ending punctuation and starting with a capital letter.   
You can edit or add more to your paragraph if you wish, or replace it all either by selecting your original input and typing new paragraphs, or clear the whole selection with the "clear" button.   

The "clear" button clears both the text box and the list. 

The "organize" button will organize whatever is in the text box.
